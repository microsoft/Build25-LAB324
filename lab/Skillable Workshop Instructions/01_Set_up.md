> [!TIP]
> What is **Azure Azure AI Foundry**? Azure AI Foundry is the ultimate platform for innovators to create generative AI solution. It offers a comprehensive suite of Azure AI capabilities and tools to design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents. It's seamlessly integrated with the world's most loved developer tools, including GitHub, Visual Studio, and Copilot Studio. Azure AI Foundry empowers developers and IT admins to bring their AI visions to life with ease and efficiency.

## Sign in to Windows
As a first step, login into the lab Virtual Machine using the following credentials:
- Username: already set to Admin.
- Password: enter +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11Base23B-W11-22H2).Password+++ and click.

> [!TIP]
>  First time using **Skillable?** The green "T" (e.g., +++Admin+++) indicates values that are automatically input for you at the current cursor location in VM, with one click. This reduces your effort and minimizes input errors.

## Sign in to Azure AI Foundry portal
   
In this workshop we will be working on Azure AI Foundry portal, focusing especially on the playground feature. 

1. On the Desktop, click on **Microsoft Edge** browser. Navigate to the second browser tab which will be showing the Azure AI Foundry portal homepage as shown in the following image.

### Project Overview

On this page, we can see an overview of our Azure AI Foundry portal Project. This includes:
- **Project Name and Description**: The name of the project and a short description of the Azure AI Foundry portal Project we are in.
- **Project details**: A collection of various properties such as the Project's connection string, its location, resource group, etc. 
- **Endpoints and keys**: Azure AI Foundry portal allows for multiple resources to be connected to it, expanding its features and functionality. Resources such as Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search and Azure AI Services further enhance the capabilities of our Project, granting us access to deployments such as LLMs or functionalities such as vector search.  Here we can find useful information such as *API endpoints and keys* and documentation.
- **Recent resources and tutorials**: Under this, your recent resources is highlighted with additional learning resources and tutorials to help you get started.

### Navigation Bar

You will notice the navigation bar has updated with new tabs, which represent functionalities tied to our project.

![project navigation bar](./Images/aifoundry-project-navigation.jpg)

We have two new sections:
1.  The first section includes _Playgrounds_ to interact with the models, _Overview_ which provides a general overview of your project, _Model Catalog_ which showcases the available models inside Azure AI Foundry, and _AI Services_ where you can see a list of Azure AI Services available along with demos, use cases and more.
1. **Build and Customize**: This includes useful opportunities to expand your project's reach, such as _working in Code_ by running a cloud compute, access to [_Prompt Flow_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow), and the ability to carry _Fine Tuning_ on your deployments.
1. **Assess and Improve:** this includes development of _Evaluations_ for your models, _tracing_ to debug your flows and _content filters_ to add guardrails to prompt inputs and completion outputs.
1. **My assets**: Here you can add additional elements to the project, with resources such as _Data_, _Indexes_, _models and endpoints_ and _Web apps_ to be used as part of your work.
1. **Management Center:** a location to manage all you  hub and project details and resources.

## Data and indexes

In this lab we are going to provide models access to a set of private data, to test its capabilities to ground responses on it. In this step, let's add this data in our Azure AI project. 

1. Navigate to **Data + Indexes**
2. Select, **New data,** and select **Upload files/folders** as **Data source**
3. Open the **Upload files or folder** dropdown, select **Upload folder** and upload the files hosted in the **product_catalog** folder on Desktop. If you can't find the folder on the VM, you can also download files [from this repo](./assets/product_catalog/).
4. Once data is uploaded, name your data as **contoso-products** and finish.
5. Next, in the same tab, navigate to index and create an index for your data.
   - Move to the **Indexes** tab in the Data + Indexes page.
   - Click on the **+ New index** button.
   - Change the default name of your index to **products-catalog**.
   - Select **Data in Azure AI Foundry** as the data source and then the data source you just uploaded.
   - In the **Index Settings** section, select the Azure AI Search connection that has been pre-provisioned for this project.
   - In the **Search Settings** section, make sure that vectorization is enabled and select the default Azure OpenAI resource for your hub as embedding model.

Move to the next section as your data is being uploaded.

## Playgrounds

You will notice we have different options for our **Playground**. Each option represents a different approach to interacting and using AI models, which can be tailored to our specific needs.

We will be doing most of our work in these Playgrounds, but namely in the following:

1. **Chat Playground**
1. **Images Playground**
1. **Real-time audio playground**
1. **Agents playground**
