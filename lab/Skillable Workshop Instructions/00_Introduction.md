# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **75-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe OpenAI model capabilities and implementation in the fields of text generation, reasoning, image generation, multimodal conversation, and Azure AI Agents.
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices.
 - Leverage generative AI capabilities and apply prompt engineering techniques to your own solutions.

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into 5 sections, taking you through generating text content, tackling complex problems, creating image assets, and code snippets through a multimodal conversational interface on Azure with OpenAI models. In addition, we will cover AI Assistants. The goal of the lab is to leverage generative AI capabilities over a wide range of scenarios.

1. **Part 1 - Text Generation** Generate text content and descriptions with GPT4o
2. **Part 2 - Reasoning Models** Solve complex problems including math, logic and code
3. **Part 3 - Image Generation** Generate image assets with DALLE-3
4. **Part 4 - Multimodality** Leverage multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o to interact with images and text.
5. **Part 5 - Azure AI Agents** Use code interpreter to understand your data.
