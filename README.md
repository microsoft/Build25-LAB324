# LAB324 - Workshop - Interacting with Multimodal Models and Agents in Azure AI Foundry

This repository hosts the Microsoft Build 2025 lab content for *Interacting with Multimodal Models and Agents in Azure AI Foundry*

## Session Description

In this hands-on lab designed for developers who are getting started in their generative AI journey, attendees will get hands-on experience with Azure AI Foundry by interacting with the latest multimodal models from the model catalog. They’ll learn core concepts and prompt engineering techniques to effectively generate text, sound, and images, mitigating the risks of inaccurate or harmful responses. They’ll also create an LLM-powered agent prototype through UI, to combine generative AI capabilities with data connectors and powerful tools, enabling the agent to take actions on behalf of the user. 

### Duration
75 Minutes

## Learning Outcomes
* Understand how Large Language Models work
* Explore Prompt Engineering techniques and Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern
* Learn how to mitigate risks of harmful content in input/output to your model
* Interact with multimodal models through different interfaces​
* Get started with building an Azure AI Agent

## Technology Used
* Azure AI Foundry portal
